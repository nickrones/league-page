       		<h1>League Rules & Constitution</h1>
	</p>

	</p>

	<h2> As a foreword to this league, and its constitution, I would like to state clearly that the mission and goal of this league is to provide the most elite, immersive experience into fantasy football possible. This is a dynasty style league where multiple players are kept from year to year and is designed so that you can build a team whose rewards you will reap from year to year. Trades will be weighed heavily. Waiver wire pickups could turn into franchise cornerstones. The design and layout of this league has been assembled in such a way to offer a long term, year round fantasy football experience that puts you as close to being an NFL general manager as possible. Let us begin….</h2>

<h3>Platform For Play</h3>
The league will be run on the “sleeper” app available on iPhone as well as all Android devices. It is 100% free and was tested this year in a one year league I participated in. It was high quality, enjoyable, and very user friendly. It also allows for a variety of individual league customization within the app for dynasty leagues which I was quite impressed with. I’m certain it would be received well by participants.

Initial Drafting 
12 team league depending on total initial participants
Snake style draft (1-12 then 12 back to 1)
Inaugural draft will have all 12 participants put into a digital randomizer (random.org) or a physical bingo ball style (if desired by participants)
Snake style draft will then resume as normal with the 1st overall pick

Following Season(s) Draft
Draft order at the end of the season will follow NFL procedure plus a lottery system
Last 6 teams (i.e non playoff teams) will be randomized in random.org for the upcoming years draft position. Each of the bottom six teams will have their name entered a certain amount of times into the random depending on their finish in the league. The list will be as follows;

12th place (last) - 10 names in the random lottery 
11th place - 7 names in the random
10th place - 5 names in the random
9th place - 3 names in the random
8th place - 2 names in the random
7th place 1 name in the random

Snake draft will then follow on draft day with whatever rookies and free agents that have not been kept are available that year
*Note Below*
ALL draft picks for all teams are tradeable. However, should you choose to trade any future pick (example - trading a 2021 3rd round pick) you will be required to provide that specific years league entry fee to the commissioner on the day of the trade before it is processed. This is to ensure that draft picks are not traded recklessly and provide adequate protection to other league members should an individual trades picks and choose not to participate in the following seasons. The goal here is for long term participation amongst the core group of people. Not to scam the league and take off like a whiny bitch after trading picks :) There is absolutely NO exception to this rule.



Yearly Keepers
Depending on where a team finishes in the league will determine how many players they are allowed to keep. Details below.


** Bottom 6 (non playoff teams) are ordered for the draft lottery according to their standing upon the conclusion of the REGULAR SEASON **


Teams finishing in spots 1-4 (champion & next 3)
Keep 4 players
Teams finishing in spots 5-8 (middle of the pack)
Keep 5 players
Teams finishing in spots 9-12 (bottom 4)
Keep 6 players
4th Ammendment (2023 “The Styles Rule aka Value alert) - Only the 6th keeper slot from a bottom 4 team may be used for draft capital compensation prior to the league draft NULL / VOID

6th Ammendment “The K2 Rule” - Any team may use a keeper slot as payment to extend a contract year player instead of paying the 1st round pick penalty.

3rd Ammendment  (Aug 1 2022) As proposed by the Ziltoid
Keeper “slots” can be traded as an asset to any other league owner
Yearly Restrictions
In an effort to keep the league as competitive (and interesting) as possible, there will be slight restrictions as to how many years in a row you may keep a given player. A “contract” if you will
Each team is allowed to keep any given player for 2 seasons, consecutively, without penalty
Should any team request to keep a player for a 3rd consecutive year, they will forfeit their 3rd round draft selection for that upcoming draft
2nd Ammendment  (Aug 1 2022) As proposed by the Ziltoid & unanimously voted
Keeping a player for 3 consecutive years will result in a 1st round pick penalty
Keeping a 2nd player for 3 consecutive years will result in a 2nd round pick penalty

5th FIF AMMENDMENT (Aug 14 2023)
All draft pick related penalties as it pertains to keepers and keeping any given player(s) for 3 years or longer will be an automatic 1st round pick penalty of that upcoming draft. Multiple players kept for 3+ years will demand additional 1st round pick compensation. 
*NOTE* when a player is traded, their “contract” resets and will be able to be kept for 2 years without penalty on their new roster


Keeper Due Date
Your keepers for the year are due 1 week before the draft
Keeper submissions can be sent via email, text message, USPS, fax, or sexy private direct message to commissioner Matthew Varao.

Team Rosters & Free Agency
Roster size & positions will be very standard throughout the year
15 player total roster size (9 starters & 6 bench)
Roster layout is as follows
QB, RB, RB, WR, WR, TE, FLEX, K, DEF -  SIX (6) BENCH - 2 IR Slots
Trades
Trades will be processed at the discretion of the commissioner
Barring a unanimous veto from the league, trades will always pass except in the instances of openly recognizable collusion by the parties involved in the trade

Team Of The Week: $20 payout each week ($260 total)
Remaining league dollars will be used to purchase a yearly engraved trophy for the league. It will be the same style and format each year to allow each champion to always have their respective years award
Weekly payouts will be issued immediately (exactly like Calcutta for those who have participated)
Yearly payouts & division winners will be sent following the championship game

I hope if you are still reading that you see yourself as a future member of this league. As commissioner, it is my goal to create the most entertaining fantasy football experience possible, and I’d love for you to be a part of it! 

Thank you, and god bless the Patriots
Commissioner
Matthew J. Varao

    <h3 class="subSectionHeading" bind:this={oneTwo}>1.2 Trading</h3>
    
    <p>Trading of players and draft picks (up to 3 drafts away) are allowed. Trades will process immediately and will be reversed if vetoed or under investigation for collusion. Tradable assets include players, draft picks, and FAAB $.</p>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoOne}>1.2.1 Trade Collusion</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>If any owners are suspected of accepting bribes/offering bribes to enhance their/another owners team via trade, trading any assets other than fantasy players, draft picks, FAAB $, or otherwise found guilty of engaging in any form of collusion*, all parties involved in the trade will be susceptible to punishment. The punishments will go as followed:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>First Offense – Immediate reduction of FAAB budget by 80%</li>
            <li>Second Offense – Immediate freeze on all transaction types for the next 18 weeks of regular season and playoff fantasy football games, including trades and waiver wire bids</li>
            <li>Third Offense – A league meeting of all members not involved in any of the improper trades/activity in question will take place to discuss next steps.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All trades that are found guilty of collusion, will be reversed/denied. If the trade had affected the outcome of previous games, the results of those games will be revised.  </p>

        <p>*Collusion includes the organizing of veto votes against an acceptable trade.</p>

        <p>The commissioner will err on the side of letting owners manage their teams the way they see fit. Any collusion will need to be clear. The commissioner reserves the right to step in and at the very least assess the thinking of any team involved in a heavily lop-sided trade. </p>
    </div>

    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoTwo}>1.2.2 Lending Players Prohibition</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>Any player traded from a team may not be re-acquired via trade within 6 weeks of the original trade. Any teams involved in this behavior will be subject to the aforementioned collusion punishments.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoThree}>1.2.3 Trade Deadline</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>The trade deadline will be set for the Saturday of the week 11 games of the NFL season.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoFour}>1.2.4 Trade Restrictions</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>You will not be able to trade draft picks that are more than 3 drafts away. For example, during the 2021 season you cannot trade any picks in or after the 2025 draft. You may only trade FAAB $ from the current season.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoFive}>1.2.5 Veto/Trade Process</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>A total of 7 veto votes are required to veto a trade. Vetoes are only appropriate in instances of collusion or an egregious mismatch of value (i.e. CMC for a backup kicker). Not liking a trade does not warrant a veto.</p>
    </div>
    
    
    
    <h3 bind:this={oneThree}>1.3 Waiver Wire</h3>
    
    <p>FAAB Waiver wire system. Each team will begin the season with $100. $0 bids are allowed. Bids will process Thursdays and Sundays at 9AM EST.</p>

    <p>FAAB budgets will reset each season in January.</p>
    
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={two}>Section 2 Drafting</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={twoOne}>2.1 Draft Order</h3>
    <p>The draft order each year will be a linear draft in reverse order of the previous year’s regular season standings.</p>

    <h3 bind:this={twoTwo}>2.2 Rookie Drafts</h3>
    <p>Rokkie drafts will consist of 3 round of drafting, with 5 minutes alotted for each pick. To make room for the incoming players, benches will be expanded by (5) spots. These spots will be removed in mid-August, at which point you will need to have cut the necessary players.</p>
    <p>Any spots not filled during the draft, can be filled immediately afterwards from the waiver wire.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={twoThree}>2.3 Draft Day Trades</h3>
    <p>If a trade is being made during the draft, one or both parties can alert the commissioner to pause the draft to allow for extra time to negotiate the trade.</p>
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={three}>Section 3 Scoring System</h2>

    <h3 bind:this={threeOne}>3.1 Scoring System</h3>
    <p>The league scoring system breakdown is listed on the Sleeper fantasy app (for the most part, it follows typical .5PPR Scoring). The scoring system will never change without a majority league vote.</p>
    
    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={four}>Section 4 Postseason</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fourOne}>4.1 Playoffs</h3>
    <p>At the end of the season 6 teams will make the playoffs. The first round of playoffs will commence in week 15. Each team that wins their division and the 4 wild card teams that finish with the best records, will receive a playoff berth. The 2 teams that win their division will receive a bye week in the first round of the playoffs. Each playoff matchup will only last one week and the winner will advance. Week 18 will not be used.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fourTwo}>4.2 Seeding Tiebreakers</h3>
    <p>If two teams finish with the same record the tiebreakers will go as followed:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Points For</li>
        <li>Head 2 Head Record</li>
        <li>Division Record</li>
        <li>Total Points Against</li>
        <li>Coin Flip</li>
        <li>Duel to the death</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={five}>Section 5 Tanking Policy</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fiveOne}>5.1 League Tanking Policy</h3>
    <p>No team may intentionally leave starting roster spots empty. Any evidence of intentionally leaving roster spots empty in order to improve your draft position may be subject to punishment, including but not limited to the forfeiture of draft selections.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={six}>Section 6 Replacing Managers</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixOne}>6.1 Removing Managers</h3>
    <p>Short of continuously failing to set a valid lineup, or confirmed collusion, no manager can be removed against their will. Participation, through the league chat, trade offers, and the waiver wire, is strongly encouraged but generally grounds for removal.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixTwo}>6.2 Replacing Managers</h3>
    <p>When a manager needs to be replaced, the commisiooners will try to find a suitable candidate with some connection to at least a portion of the existing managers. Priority will be placed on managers who are eager to take on a dynasty commitment and will be very active within the league.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixThree}>6.3 Replacement Incentive</h3>
    <p>In the event that a manager chooses to quit the league or is removed by a comissioner, an incoming manager is offered a 50% reductioon on their first year buy-in.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={seven}>Section 7 League Finances</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenOne}>7.1 League Dues</h3>
    <p>League dues are set at {dues}$. Dues are collected through <a href="https://www.leaguesafe.com/league/3949641">LeagueSafe</a> and collection will be sent out no later than the first of August. All managers must be fully paid up before the start of regular season. In the event that a manager fails to pay before the deadline, a 10% penalty will be addd to their payment and will go towards the payouts at the end of the year.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenTwo}>7.2 Payout</h3>
    <p>League payout is structured as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1st place: {dues * 8}$</li>
        <li>2nd place: {dues * 3}$</li>
        <li>3rd place: {dues}$</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the event that a manager was fined due to late payment, their extra fee will be added to the winner's payout. Similarly, if new managers come into the league and the payout is smaller, the difference will come out of the winner's prize.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenThree}>7.3 Raising Dues</h3>
    <p>A ⅔ majority vote is required in order to raise league dues. In the event that a manager is no longer financially comfortable with the buyin, finding a co-manager to split the cost is reccomended.</p>
